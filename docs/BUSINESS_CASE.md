# Business Case: Forex Risk Calculator Platform

## Executive Summary

**Investment Ask:** $150K for 6-month pilot program
**Expected 24-Month ROI:** 18x return ($2.7M revenue on $150K investment)
**Payback Period:** 8 months
**Strategic Value:** Establish platform in $8.2B market with minimal direct competition

## Problem Statement

### Broker Pain Points (Validated Through Market Research)

**1. Catastrophic Client Churn**
- Industry average: 60-70% of new forex traders quit within 90 days
- Primary reason: Poor risk management leads to rapid account blowouts
- Broker cost: $300-$500 CAC per client lost to churn

**2. Regulatory Compliance Burden**
- ESMA (EU) and NFA (US) require brokers to demonstrate client education
- Manual compliance documentation costs brokers $50K-$200K annually
- Penalties for inadequate risk disclosure: $500K-$5M per violation

**3. Commoditized Market = Price Competition**
- Brokers compete primarily on spreads and leverage (race to bottom)
- Limited differentiation leads to 5% avg. profit margins
- Need value-added services to justify premium pricing

**4. Client Support Overwhelm**
- 40% of support tickets are basic risk/position sizing questions
- Average support cost: $15 per ticket
- High-touch support doesn't scale with client acquisition

### Quantified Impact
For a typical mid-tier broker (2,000 active clients):
- **Churn cost:** $300,000/year (500 churned clients × $600 total CAC)
- **Compliance cost:** $120,000/year (documentation + legal review)
- **Support cost:** $90,000/year (6,000 tickets × $15)
- **Total annual pain:** $510,000

## Proposed Solution

   - Position sizing based on account balance, risk %, stop loss

   - Risk management best practices (2% rule, correlation)
   - Audit trail of all educational content shown to each client

3. **Broker Admin Dashboard**
   - Client risk profile analytics
   - Compliance reporting (proof of education)
   - Usage metrics and engagement tracking

4. **White-Label Infrastructure**

   - API integration with broker platforms
   - Embeddable widget for broker websites

## Financial Projections

### Revenue Model

- Mid-tier broker (2,000 clients, 40% monthly active = 800 MAU)
- Monthly revenue: $2,500 base + $400 usage = $2,900/month
- Annual contract value (ACV): $34,800

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Build Full Trading Platform (MT4 Competitor)
- **Cost:** $2M-$5M development
- **Time to Market:** 18-24 months
- **Risk:** High - competing with entrenched incumbents (MT4/MT5 90% market share)
- **Decision:** ❌ Rejected - too capital intensive, low differentiation

### Alternative 2: Sell Directly to Traders (B2C SaaS)
- **Pricing:** $19/month subscription
- **TAM:** 10M retail forex traders globally
- **Challenge:** High CAC ($50-$100), low LTV ($150-$200), 5-7% conversion
- **Decision:** ❌ Rejected - Unit economics unfavorable vs. B2B model

### Alternative 3: Focus on Prop Firms Only
- **Market Size:** ~200 major prop firms
- **ACV:** $50K-$100K (larger than brokers)
- **Challenge:** Longer sales cycles (9-12 months), customization demands
- **Decision:** ⚠️ Considered for Year 2 expansion, not primary GTM

### Recommended Approach: B2B White-Label for Brokers (Current Plan)
- ✅ Large TAM with clear pain points
- ✅ Favorable unit economics (7.8x ROI for customers)
- ✅ Recurring revenue with high retention
- ✅ Differentiated positioning (complementary, not competitive)
- ✅ Reasonable development cost and timeline
