## 💡 The Business Problem

### Broker Pain Points
- **60-70% client churn** within 90 days (traders blow up accounts due to poor risk management)
- **$300-$500 CAC** wasted on clients who quit immediately
- **Regulatory pressure** from ESMA/NFA to demonstrate client education
- **Commoditized market** - brokers compete only on spreads (5% margins)
- **$90K/year** in support costs for basic risk management questions

### Quantified Impact
For a typical mid-tier broker (2,000 active clients):
- **$300,000/year** lost to churn (500 churned clients × $600 CAC)
- **$120,000/year** compliance documentation costs
- **$90,000/year** in risk-related support tickets
- **Total annual pain:** $510,000
